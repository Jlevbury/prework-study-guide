# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In order to create an organic resource of coding reference material to aid in developing the skills during the coding bootcamp, a single point of entry was necessary to ease the burden of information overload on the student. 

 With the creation of a Study Guide Webpage, it provides a canvas for the student to collect data during the coursework, implement its use in an environment that has the built in utility to gain experience through repetition and receive real-time feedback on the input being added to the study guide. Additionally , the student is able to generate curated reference material that reflects on the experience of the individual , thus providing the opportunity to self identify learning weak points and encourage continuous note taking.

Learning any new language can be difficult, learning multiple new languages is extremely difficult, in our case, it is several programming languages. This Study Guide Webpage is, in a sense our interpreter, or phrase book if thought of in the traditional language sense. By creating a webpage that the student can reference off of, to complete difficult to recall syntax structures, or ensure new information is being put to use and retained by the student, maintaining this study guide provides just the environment needed.

## Learning Experience
 In building this Study Guide Webpage, comprehension was gained in the linkages between the programming languages necessary to create an operational webpage. During the process of construction each page of code for HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in addition to the introduction of GitHub and its interfacing with the local terminal, several concepts discussed in the prework reading became self apparent. Debugging on a habitual routine proved itself to be incredibly useful, as when it was not used at normal intervals, the lesson it taught was painful when the error was finally discovered and its simplicity was revealed. Often times Occam's Razor proved the best tool for solving these issues, a missing character or wrong bracket type fixed what was the cure to the ailment. 

With the introduction of GitHub and its workflow an order of operations was introduced and if not adhered to provided its own difficulties, which also provided learning opportunities. In particular learning the command to delete a branch on a local level was not in the scope of the prework course topics, however due to an error in creating a branch, then deleting from the web side of the operation resulted in the need to troubleshoot how to fix this and move forward. As proof of concept for the use of this webpage, this command has been added to the "Git" portion of the page, including the command to perform the delete operation if necessary.

## Usage
This Study Guide is intended to be an organic work environment that reflects the needs of the student during their completion of the Coding Bootcamp. Each section of the page captures notes on each of the topics covered and reflects on usage notes the student would like to have readily available to reference for future use. Beyond the default appearance of the site, when utilizing the DevTools console, code written can be reviewed, CSS style sheets can be found under "Elements" and within the "Console" header, the active JavaScript can be viewed and lines of script are referenced for easy navigation.
